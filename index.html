          I was born January 28, 1993 in Brookhaven MS. My parrents, currently married for over 36 years,
          have moved over 20 times in thier marriage together. In my life time I have moved 10 times by the time I left
          home.
          I have an older sister 8 and a half years older than me, and a younger brother 8 years younger than me. I am
          an almost
          directly in the middle child. I had lived most of my life in Mississippi until I graduated college, living
          mostly in
          south MS untill Hurricane Katrina in 2005. After that we moved closer to north MS near Oxford, a hour's drive
          from Memphis TN.
          I went to Ole Miss in Oxford for a BA in English. It took 5 years for some reason. I also graduated with a
          minor in Cinema.
          I met and moved in with my current girlfriend where she lived in Cherokee North Carolina for 8 months till we
          moved to
          Austin Texas in Januray 2017.

          I have over 10 years of experiance in the food industry. I have done everything from dish washing, bussing,
          waiting, cooking
          and prepping. The food industry sucks and is really exhuasting so the idea of getting out of it in any way is
          great. However,
          I do realy love to cook and do so all the time still at home. <br>
          I really love film and while Ole Miss didn't have a prolific Cinema program, my Minor in Cinema was my main
          goal
          hoping to start writing film scripts. I moved to Austin to try and get into the indie film inustry, and while
          its never too
          late, it seems smarter at this time to learn a new skill that has a wider range of career paths and job
          openings like coding.
